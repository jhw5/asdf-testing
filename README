Build:
  Windows: Run 'deploy-nphrases-ftp.bat'.
  
Run:

  Run from Import Content:
    Check the 'nphrases' box in the Associated Content bar.
  
  Run from ML: 
    Run np:create-nphrases($product-edition, $filename) in nphrase-management.xqm
      -get the product edition using products.xqm
      
  The two above methods use the configuration settings in nphrase-config.xml.
      
  Run from browser:
  
    NOTE: now requires a valid authorization token. To use, manually insert a token first.
    http://192.168.0.87:8080/nphrases/servlet?filename=[filename]&product=[PRODUCT]&edition=[EDITION]&xcc-url=[ML-ADDRESS:]9003&xcc-credentials=[USERNAME:PASSWORD]&token=[TOKEN]
    This is the URL for running on JavaVM. If running on a local servlet, make sure the port number is correct.
    The correct port is the one used by Tomcat's HTTP connector, found in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml.
      Query string arguments: 
      -filename: filename of document to be processed
      -product: product document belongs to
      -edition: edition (year) of product
      -xcc-url: URL used by Java webapp (via XCC) to connect to ML. 
          format: ADDRESS:PORT
          To have XCC connect back to your local machine, you may include only the port number in this
          parameter, and the servlet will give the address that sent the HTTP request to XCC,
            as in http://192.168.0.87:8080/nphrases/servlet?uri=[URI]&product=[PRODUCT]&xcc-url=9003
      -xcc-credentials: Username and password for an ML public user, used by XCC to access the ML server
      -token: valid authorization token
     
      
      
JavaVM:
  The NPhraseServlet on JavaVM should be running at all times. If it is not running, start it by running C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-8.0.9\bin\startup.bat and check the status of the scheduled task 'Start Tomcat'.
